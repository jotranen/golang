 * Exercise 10.4: Construct a tool that reports the set of all packages in the workspace that transitively depend on
 * the packages specified by the arguments. Hint: you will need to run go list twice, once for the initial packages
 * and once for all packages. You may want to parse its JSON output using the encoding/ json package (ยง 4.5).
