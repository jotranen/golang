/*
 * Exercise 8.2: Implement a concurrent File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. The server should interpret commands from each client such as cd to change directory, ls to list a directory, get to send the contents of a file, and close to close the connection. You can use the standard ftp command as the client, or write your own.
