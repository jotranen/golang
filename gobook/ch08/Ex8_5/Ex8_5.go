/*
 * Exercise 8.5: Take an existing CPU-bound sequential program, such as the Mandelbrot program of Section 3.3 or the 3-D surface computation of Section 3.2, and execute its main loop in parallel using channels for communication. How much faster does it run on a multiprocessor machine? What is the optimal number of goroutines to use?
