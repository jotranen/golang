/*
 * Exercise 11.7: Write benchmarks for Add, UnionWith, and other methods of *IntSet (ยง 6.5) using large pseudo-random inputs.
 * How fast can you make these methods run? How does the choice of word size affect performance?
 * How fast is IntSet compared to a set implementation based on the built-in map type?
