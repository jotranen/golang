/*
 * Exercise 7.18: Using the token-based decoder API, write a program that will read an arbitrary XML document
 * and construct a tree of generic nodes that represents it. Nodes are of two kinds:
 * CharData nodes represent text strings, and Element nodes represent named elements and their attributes.
 * Each element node has a slice of child nodes.
